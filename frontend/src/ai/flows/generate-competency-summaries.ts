TASK: Generate specific, evidence-based summaries for this competency:

**Instructions for strengthSummary**:
- Write 2-3 lines highlighting what the candidate did well in demonstrating this competency
- Focus on professional judgment, workplace appropriateness, and competency understanding shown
- Reference the spirit and approach of their responses rather than specific phrases
- Use positive, professional language that recognizes competency demonstration

**Instructions for weaknessSummary**:
- Write 2-3 lines identifying areas where the candidate could strengthen this competency
- Focus on gaps in professional approach or competency understanding
- Provide constructive feedback for competency development rather than specific phrase requirements
- Be specific about competency skills they should focus on improving

Both summaries should be:
- Specific to this competency only
- Evidence-based (referencing their actual responses)
- Professional and constructive in tone
- Actionable for development purposes`,
