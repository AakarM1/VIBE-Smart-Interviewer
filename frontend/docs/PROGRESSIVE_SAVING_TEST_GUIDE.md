# 🧪 **PROGRESSIVE SAVING - TESTING GUIDE**

## 🚀 **Quick Start Testing**

### **Step 1: Enable Features**
Create or update `.env.local` in your project root:
```bash
# Enable progressive saving features for testing
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_PROGRESSIVE_SAVE=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_SESSION_RECOVERY=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_ENHANCED_PROGRESS=true
```

### **Step 2: Restart Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### **Step 3: Test Progressive Saving**
1. Go to `/interview` page
2. Start an interview
3. Answer Question 1 and click "Submit Answer"
4. **Look for**: Toast notification "Your answer has been saved automatically"
5. **Check browser console**: Should see `✅ [PartialSubmission] Question saved with ID: xxx`

### **Step 4: Test Session Recovery**
1. Start an interview and answer 2-3 questions
2. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+R or F5)
3. **Look for**: Session recovery modal asking "Resume Your Interview?"
4. Click "Resume from Question X"
5. **Verify**: You continue from where you left off

## 🔍 **Detailed Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Normal Progressive Flow**
```
✅ Expected Behavior:
1. Start interview → Progressive session starts
2. Answer Q1 → Saves to database immediately
3. Answer Q2 → Saves to database immediately  
4. Finish interview → Session marked complete
5. Check Firestore → partialSubmissions collection has entries
```

### **Scenario 2: Session Recovery Flow**
```
✅ Expected Behavior:
1. Start interview, answer 3 questions
2. Refresh browser before finishing
3. Recovery modal appears with progress (3/10 completed)
4. Click "Resume" → Continues from question 4
5. Finish interview → All data preserved
```

### **Scenario 3: Network Interruption**
```
✅ Expected Behavior:
1. Start interview
2. Disconnect internet during question submission
3. Submit button shows "Will save when online"
4. Reconnect internet
5. Question saves automatically
```

### **Scenario 4: Feature Disabled (Backward Compatibility)**
```bash
# In .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_PROGRESSIVE_SAVE=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_SESSION_RECOVERY=false
```

```
✅ Expected Behavior:
1. Identical to original system
2. No progressive saving
3. No session recovery modal
4. All existing functionality preserved
```

## 🔧 **Developer Console Debugging**

### **Progressive Save Success**
```
🚀 [Interview] Starting progressive session...
✅ [Interview] Progressive session started: session_1234567890_abc123
💾 [Interview] Progressive save enabled, saving question...
💾 [PartialSubmission] Saving question 1 of 10
✅ [PartialSubmission] Question saved with ID: abc123def456
```

### **Session Recovery Detection**
```
🔍 [Interview] Checking for recoverable sessions...
🔄 [Interview] Found recoverable session, showing modal
🔄 [Interview] Resuming session: session_1234567890_abc123
✅ [Interview] Session resumed successfully
```

### **Feature Disabled**
```
⚠️ [Progressive] Progressive save disabled, skipping...
```

## 📊 **Database Verification**

### **Check Firestore Collections**

#### **1. partialSubmissions Collection**
```javascript
// In Firebase Console or emulator UI
// Look for documents like:
{
  sessionId: "session_1234567890_abc123",
  userId: "user123",
  candidateName: "Test User",
  interviewType: "JDT",
  questionIndex: 0,
  question: "Tell me about yourself",
  answer: "I am a software developer...",
  timestamp: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  status: "saved",
  isComplete: false
}
```

#### **2. submissions Collection (Unchanged)**
```javascript
// Traditional final submissions still work exactly the same
{
  candidateName: "Test User",
  testType: "JDT", 
  history: [...], // All questions and answers
  report: {...},  // Analysis results
  date: "2025-01-15T10:35:00Z"
}
```

## 🧪 **Advanced Testing**

### **Multi-User Testing**
1. Open interview in 2+ browser tabs/users
2. Both users answer questions simultaneously  
3. Verify no conflicts in database
4. Check that each user has separate sessionIds

### **Performance Testing**
1. Answer questions rapidly (rapid-fire clicking)
2. Monitor network tab for database calls
3. Verify no blocking or delays
4. Check for any failed save attempts

### **Error Scenario Testing**
1. **Database Offline**: Disconnect Firebase → Progressive saves should fail gracefully
2. **Network Issues**: Throttle network → Automatic retries should work
3. **Browser Storage Full**: Simulate storage limit → Fallback mechanisms
4. **Page Navigation**: Leave page during save → Session should be recoverable

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Progressive Save Not Working**
```bash
# Check environment variables
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_PROGRESSIVE_SAVE

# Check browser console for errors
# Look for: "Progressive save disabled" or error messages
```

### **Session Recovery Not Showing**
```bash
# Ensure feature is enabled
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_SESSION_RECOVERY=true

# Check that you have incomplete sessions
# Look in partialSubmissions collection for isComplete: false
```

### **Database Connection Issues**
```bash
# For Firebase Emulator (development)
npm run emulators:start

# Check Firebase config in src/lib/firebase.ts
# Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_* environment variables
```

### **Build/Compilation Errors**
```bash
# Check TypeScript compilation
npm run type-check

# Check for missing dependencies
npm install

# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```
